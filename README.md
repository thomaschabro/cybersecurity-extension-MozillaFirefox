# cybersecurity-extension-MozillaFirefox

This Mozilla Firefox plugin is designed to enhance your security while navigating on the internet. With detection scripts, it actively identifies and alerts you to potential attacks and data leaks.

Capable of detecting:

- Connections to third part domains while navigating.
- Amount of cookies injected when loading a page.
- Data stored in client's local storage by html5 applications.
- Cookies synchronism.
- Canvas fingerprints.

Using those detections, the plugin will calculate and display a security score for the current page.
