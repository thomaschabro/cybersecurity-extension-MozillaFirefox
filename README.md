# Cyber Security Extension - MozillaFirefox

![alt text](icons/cyber-security.png)

This Mozilla Firefox plugin is designed to enhance your security while navigating on the internet. With detection scripts, it actively identifies and alerts you to potential attacks and data leaks.

**Capable of detecting:**

- Connections to third part domains while navigating.
- Amount of cookies injected when loading a page.
- Data stored in client's local storage by html5 applications.
- Cookies synchronism.
- Canvas fingerprints.

Using those detections, the plugin will calculate and display a security score for the current page.
